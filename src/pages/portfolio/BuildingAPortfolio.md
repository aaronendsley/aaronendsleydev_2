## “Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.” ― Douglas Wilson, Ploductivity: A Practical Theology of Work & Wealth

I have built this site over and over and over again. I have built this site in regular ole HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I've built it in Jquery and Bootstrap, ReactJS, GatsbyJS, Svelte, fill in the blank framework of the week. Everytime I have learned something new I've rebuilt this site. I always found something i did not like about the other tools i used to build previous iterations of this site. I needed to use the right tools for the right job. 

Why is Astro the right tool for this site? The reason I think is because it makes things like building this blog less time consuming. It combines all the things i love about frameworks like Svelte, Vue, and React, while still feeling like simple HTML CSS and Javscript. Astro gets out of my way to allow me to create a simple site, all the benefits of awesome static site generators like gatsby without the hassle of having to set up various plugins, I've used Gatsby on other projects and its a good tool, but it is just not the best tool for a site this simple. 

The Docs for Astro were extreamly simple to use, and the tutorials on the website make it very simple to learn how to use Astro. I did not know how to use Astro, I went through the blog tutorial they have on their site, and from there I was able to build my site from scratch after doing a tutorial for at most an hour and reading a little documentation. Overall I am impressed with astro and will be using it to build simple sites when it is the right tool for the job.
