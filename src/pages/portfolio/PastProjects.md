## "Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives. I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because it will never come again." - Captain Jean Luc Picard in Star Trek: Generations

Below you will find a link. A Link to projects I have done in the past. Most of these projects are no longer on the internet. But each of them brought me to where I am today and taught me something new. I look on each of these projects fondly and am grateful to have been able to have had the opportunities to work on them!
