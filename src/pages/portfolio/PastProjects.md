## "Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives. I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because it will never come again." - Captain Jean Luc Picard in Star Trek: Generations

Below you will find a link. A Link to projects I have done in the past. Most of these projects are no longer on the internet. Each project taught me something new, and overall has made me unafraid of trying new things. From web development to graphic design, and photography, I look on each of these projects fondly and am grateful to have been able to have had the opportunities to work on them! The experiences I have had building these have helped me even in all of my endeavors today.
